  abstract = {Gravity interpretation of large sedimentary basins requires a large number of observations and of parameters estimations, so the development of very efficient gravity inversion methods applicable to such environments is of utmost importance. We found that the highly efficient Bott's method can be cast in the framework of Gauss-Newton's method for minimizing nonlinear functions. Also, we extended Bott's method to (1)~be applicable to sedimentary basins with density contrast between the sediments and the basement decreasing with depth according to different laws, (2)~optimize the modulus of the parameter correction vector, (3)~stabilize the solution by imposing that it be smooth, and (4)~quit the iteration according to an objective and effective criterion. To keep up the efficiency of Bott's method, stable solutions were obtained by applying a moving average to the usually unstable solution obtained at the last iteration. Solutions as efficacious as those obtained by the usual nonlinear method were produced by the present extension at a much smaller computation time. Nonlinear methods, with different implementations for solving a linear system of equations, required between one and two orders of magnitude more time to produce similar solutions using between 2000 and 3000 parameters and observations, for example.},

  title = {Optimized Formulas for the Gravitational Field of a Tesseroid},
  volume = {87},
  issn = {0949-7714, 1432-1394},
  doi = {10.1007/s00190-013-0636-1},
  abstract = {Various tasks in geodesy, geophysics, and related geosciences require precise information on the impact of mass distributions on gravity field-related quantities, such as the gravitational potential and its partial derivatives. Using forward modeling based on Newton's integral, mass distributions are generally decomposed into regular elementary bodies. In classical approaches, prisms or point mass approximations are mostly utilized. Considering the effect of the sphericity of the Earth, alternative mass modeling methods based on tesseroid bodies (spherical prisms) should be taken into account, particularly in regional and global applications. Expressions for the gravitational field of a point mass are relatively simple when formulated in Cartesian coordinates. In the case of integrating over a tesseroid volume bounded by geocentric spherical coordinates, it will be shown that it is also beneficial to represent the integral kernel in terms of Cartesian coordinates. This considerably simplifies the determination of the tesseroid's potential derivatives in comparison with previously published methodologies that make use of integral kernels expressed in spherical coordinates. Based on this idea, optimized formulas for the gravitational potential of a homogeneous tesseroid and its derivatives up to second-order are elaborated in this paper. These new formulas do not suffer from the polar singularity of the spherical coordinate system and can, therefore, be evaluated for any position on the globe. Since integrals over tesseroid volumes cannot be solved analytically, the numerical evaluation is achieved by means of expanding the integral kernel in a Taylor series with fourth-order error in the spatial coordinates of the integration point. As the structure of the Cartesian integral kernel is substantially simplified, Taylor coefficients can be represented in a compact and computationally attractive form. Thus, the use of the optimized tesseroid formulas particularly benefits from a significant decrease in computation time by about 45 \% compared to previously used algorithms. In order to show the computational efficiency and to validate the mathematical derivations, the new tesseroid formulas are applied to two realistic numerical experiments and are compared to previously published tesseroid methods and the conventional prism approach.},

  abstract = {We have developed a gravity inversion method to estimate a discontinuous basement relief based on an extended version of Bott's method that allows variable density contrasts between sediments and basement, optimizes the modulus of the solution correction at each iteration, and provides for solution stabilization. Initially, we obtain a linear approximation stabilized by the total variation functional that correctly maps the horizontal positions of the existing high-angle faults but produced poor estimates of the basin depths. Subsequent iterations update the depth estimates toward the correct values, at the same time preserving the correct fault horizontal positions. Additionally, we stabilize each solution correction by the smoothness constraint without inverting any matrix. The method was substantially more efficient than the nonlinear method, which solves a system of linear equations by the conjugate gradient method at each iteration. For 3000 parameters, it is almost four times faster than the conjugate gradient, and this ratio increased with the number of parameters.},

  volume = {81},
  issn = {0949-7714, 1432-1394},
  doi = {10.1007/s00190-006-0094-0},
  abstract = {The calculation of topographic (and iso- static) reductions is one of the most time-consuming operations in gravity field modelling. For this calculation, the topographic surface of the Earth is often divided with respect to geographical or map-grid lines, and the topographic heights are averaged over the respective grid elements. The bodies bounded by surfaces of constant (ellipsoidal) heights and geographical grid lines are denoted as tesseroids. Usually these ellipsoidal (or spherical) tesseroids are replaced by ``equivalent'' vertical rectangular prisms of the same mass. This approximation is motivated by the fact that the volume integrals for the calculation of the potential and its derivatives can be exactly solved for rectangular prisms, but not for the tesseroids. In this paper, an approximate solution of the spherical tesseroid integrals is provided based on series expansions including third-order terms. By choosing the geometrical centre of the tesseroid as the Taylor expansion point, the number of non-vanishing series terms can be greatly reduced. The zero-order term is equivalent to the point-mass formula. Test computations show the high numerical efficiency of the tesseroid method versus the prism approach, both regarding computation time and accuracy. Since the approximation errors due to the truncation of the Taylor series decrease very quickly with increasing distance of the tesseroid from the computation point, only the elements in the direct vicinity of the computation point have to be separately evaluated, e.g. by the prism formulas. The results are also compared with the point-mass formula. Further potential refinements of the tesseroid approach, such as considering ellipsoidal tesseroids, are indicated.},

  abstract = {A gravity inversion method is developed by iteratively applying open, reject, and fill (O-R-F) criteria within a model space comprising a great many rectangular prisms. Each prism is assigned a density contrast. The modeling procedure consists of filling some prisms while leaving others empty. Only one element is filled for each pass. Generally, elements are added only to the periphery of the growing model. Models can be allowed to grow in any combination of directions, or in all directions. By application of a ``shape-of-anomaly'' fill criterion, the model rapidly attains a form which yields gravity approximating the given gravity scaled down by some constant factor. As the model continues to grow, this scale factor approaches unity. The method readily yields inverse models comprising several thousand individual prisms. Examples presented here give applications to 2-D problems. The method is readily applicable to 212-D212-D$<$math overflow="scroll"$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$mn$>$2$<$/mn$>$$<$mfrac$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$mn$>$1$<$/mn$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$mn$>$2$<$/mn$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/mfrac$>$$<$mo$>$-$<$/mo$>$$<$mi$>$D$<$/mi$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/math$>$ and 3-D problems as well. Overhanging elements are obtained by appropriate use of model constraints. Initial density models are not required but they are allowed. An ``expanding seed'' method is explained which efficiently generates sets of inverse models by using dense models to initiate development of less dense models. The method is applied to inversion of several synthetic gravity profiles from known density models. A density model is also derived from gravity across the Troodos massif in Cyprus. Using a density contrast of 310kg/m3310kg/m3$<$math overflow="scroll"$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$mn$>$310$<$/mn$>$$<$mspace width="0.16em"$>$$<$/mspace$>$$<$mi$>$kg$<$/mi$>$$<$mo$>$/$<$/mo$>$$<$msup$>$$<$mi$>$m$<$/mi$>$$<$mrow$>$$<$mn$>$3$<$/mn$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/msup$>$$<$/mrow$>$$<$/math$>$, the resultant model extends from the surface to a depth of 20.6 km and has a center of mass distribution displaced approximately 7 km to the northeast of the anomaly peak.},

  abstract = {We describe a novel method implemented in the GPlates plate tectonic reconstruction software to interactively reconstruct arbitrarily high-resolution raster data to past geological times using a rotation model. The approach is based on the projection of geo-referenced raster data into a cube map followed by a reverse projection onto rotated tectonic plates on the surface of the globe. This decouples the rendering of a geo-referenced raster from its reconstruction, providing a number of benefits including a simple implementation and the ability to combine rasters with different geo-referencing or inbuilt raster projections. The cube map projection is accelerated by graphics hardware in a wide variety of computer systems manufactured over the last decade. Furthermore, by integrating a multi-resolution tile partitioning into the cube map we can provide on-demand tile streaming, level-of-detail rendering and hierarchical visibility culling, enabling researchers to visually explore essentially unlimited resolution geophysical raster data attached to tectonic plates and reconstructed through geological time. This capability forms the basis for interactively building and improving plate reconstructions in an iterative fashion, particularly for tectonically complex regions.},
